                <h3 class="entry-title">What is Open Innovation Lab?</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="entry-bd">
                <p>Open Innovation Lab (OIL) is part of the Climate-KIC Accelerator programme.  In the context of the Climate-KIC Accelerator, OIL aims to be a collaborative platform for rapid prototyping via learning, research, development and production, with wraparound support in developing the selected concepts.  The goal will be to enhance these concepts via collaborative interventions during the one week workshop.  This work will be carried out in multi- and interdisciplinary task groups comprised by the concept originator(s) and interested collaborators, with conceptual and technical advice from the experts and facilitators.  As an introduction to the workshop there will be an agenda of industry talks from invited speakers on the themes of innovation, green tech, intellectual property, among others.</p>
                <p>OIL is looking for individuals to participate in this collaborative innovation workshop in an environment of openness, exploration, and shared horizontal learning, research, development and production.  The workshop aims to use Free/Libre Open Source (FLOS) software and hardware tools and related technologies.  Think of this as a special unique opportunity to approach things in a, perhaps more experimental, way you would not normally dare to do.</p>
                <p>OIL will bring people from different disciplines from the West Midlands, Ireland and wider Europe to work collaboratively on enhancing the selected concepts by taking new perspectives and approaches to underlying climate related challenges.</p>
                <p>OIL will enable participants to appreciate where business ideas fit in the smart, knowledge-driven, low carbon economy.  Government innovation policy in the UK and Ireland has traditionally focused on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and the ‘eight great technologies’.  However, this omits how to factor in creative thinking into the technological mix.  As such, STEAM — STEM with an Art component — is seen as a key opportunity for Europe.</p>
                <p>OIL will be led by Birmingham City University’s Cross Innovation team, which has experience in bringing in and sharing best practice with practitioners, businesses and institutions from across Europe, notably via its key development role in the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF).  The delivery will be shared with Sampad, a Birmingham-based organisation working in multi-disciplinary, international collaborative practices.</p>
                <p>OIL was born from a research and production methodology called <a href="http://www.interactivosbham.co.uk/about" target="_blank">‘Interactivos’</a>, developed by Madrid-based <a href="http://medialab-prado.es/" target="_blank">Medialab Prado</a> for the creative and educational uses of all technology.  These events are a hybrid between a production workshop, a seminar and promotion of the developments via public showcase.  ‘Interactivos’ makes space for reflection, new thinking and collaboration, enabling proposals to be researched, developed, produced and presented.</p>

                <h3 class="entry-title">Innovation and Sustainability Conferences</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="entry-bd">
                <p>Hosted as part of Climate-KIC’s business incubator programme, Birmingham City University would like to welcome you to the kick-off of the Open Innovation Lab for a one day event about the future of smart cities and how design can boost innovation and create economic growth.</p>
                <p>Birmingham City University has teamed up with Climate-KIC to run an Open Innovation Lab, a collaborative platform for rapid prototyping, with a multi-perspective focus.  OIL is stage 2 of the Climate-KIC Accelerator, which focusses on climate change via cleantech commercialisation.  This echoes Climate-KIC’s approach to breaking down siloes between sectors and disciplines, ensuring that those who have the motivation, capacity and skills to tackle problems relating to climate change through business activity are working together, enabling them to come up with sustainable, cutting-edge solutions.  It is intended to take participants out of their comfort zone and draw on skills and experience from outside their sector.</p>
                <p>This Innovation Conference is your opportunity to engage and hear from world leading experts in the social, economic and environmental fields on design-led processes and how it adds value to products and services and improves customer experiences.  There will be a series of debates, provocative discussions and, in the true spirit of disruption, to play and to dabble as well.</p>
                <p>What better place than Innovation Birmingham to do this, to meet some of the most active innovators as well as some international superstars in this arena. Conferences' contributors include:</p>

              <div class="entry-bd">
                <p>The seven days of the Climate-KIC Open Innovation Lab will be a mixture of expert input and masterclasses, interactive workshops in mixed groups, with a large proportion of time dedicated to Lab sessions for groups to develop their ideas with mentoring and coaching support available as needed.  A variety of innovation models and tools will be introduced along with business planning and product development/deployment approaches and support.</p>
                <p>The OI Lab agenda is planned out as follows, but is designed to be flexible and responsive to the needs of the groups throughout the week and so may be amended to fit with developments or changing requirements.  The principle is to balance external input with time to apply new learning and develop business ideas — providing new tools and approaches that can be used during the OI Lab but also in the future, as well as ensuring groups can use the time, techniques and support to significantly develop their ideas and their businesses during the week long programme.</p>

                  <dd>
                    <p>Fresh from the Innovation & Sustainability Conferences on the previous day, the Innovation Labs kicks off with an introduction and overview of what to expect over the following 7 days, along with an overview on Open Innovation and how it will be used during the programme.  Businesses will then pitch their proposed projects to the group and collaborators will introduce themselves and their skills, followed by formation of the working groups for the week.</p>
                    <p>We’ll grab some pizza for lunch and then introduce the innovation framework which underpins the process being used.  We’ll then focus in on the first stage of the framework, working in the newly formed groups to define and communicate the problems (or opportunities) being tackled by each business.  More pitching as each group summarises their problem/opportunity.</p>

                  <dd>
                    <p>Friday is about transition from problem framing to ideation, generating and/or developing ideas and using an Open Innovation approach to strengthen and stretch these, through and combination of masterclasses and interactive workshops.  Groups will then find out a bit more about the required outputs for the end of the week and then have the first of many focused Lab sessions, providing a “make space” for groups to develop ideas and build/prototype them, supported by the coaches and mentors.</p>

                    <p>Saturday is a key day in the programme, where groups will participate in a series of User Lab sessions, a unique opportunity to test ideas and prototypes with a variety of people and gain crucial feedback and evidence needed to validate ideas and refine products.  Each group will participate in multiple, short User Lab sessions with time to develop and refine prototypes in between, supported by the mentoring team.  A very busy day, but followed by relaxing with a BBQ and beers from midafternoon onwards.</p>

                  <dd>
                    <p>A flexible day with relaxed and open Lab sessions with mentors on hand to assist if required.  No set structure, just some time to develop you ideas, work on your prototypes or reflect on your progress or learning journey so far or just to let it all sink in.  Finish mid-afternoon followed by a social evening.</p>

                    <p>After a more relaxed Sunday, the pace picks back up again.  Starting off with a critical review of progress so far and chance for groups to reflect on their progress (one of the key elements needed for the Influence Lab on Wednesday) groups will then press on with developing their solutions and business propositions with mentors on hand, as ever.  After some fish & chips, there's then more Lab Time in the afternoon, getting ready for the final straight.</p>

                <h4 class="entry-subtitle">Birmingham City University</h4>
                <p>With around 23,500 students from 80 different countries, BCU is one of the largest universities in the UK.  BCU plays a number of key roles in the development of the creative economy and works as a catalyst to bring fresh perspectives and new ideas to the marketplace, by working with regional organisations to encourage cross-sector partnerships; stimulate collaborative projects; promote collective strengths and embed enterprise into curriculum.  To that end BCU has set up a <a href="http://www.cross-innovation.eu/" target="_blank">Cross Innovation</a> project to promote collaborative and user-driven innovation that happens across sectorial, organisational, technological and geographic boundaries.</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.bcu.ac.uk/research/-centres-of-excellence/centre-for-low-carbon-technologies" target="_blank">The Centre for Low-Carbon Research</a> aims to address the rapid transition required towards a low-carbon economy, to reduce climate change due to increasing consumption of energy and to create a more sustainable society.  This needs close-to-market research to reduce the carbon emissions of existing technologies, fundamental research into alternative energy sources and reduction of energy demand.  Such research requires a multi-disciplinary approach, combining technological expertise with an understanding of societal factors including public policy that govern uptake.  This is a major focus of research funding from the EU and UK governments and research councils.  Key research themes include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Bioenergy</li>
                  <li>Low carbon transportation</li>
                  <li>Intelligent buildings</li>
                  <li>Supply chain logistics</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These themes will also provide a focus for cross-University collaboration in research, knowledge exchange and technology transfer.</p>
                <p>The Centre has access to a range of excellent research facilities, including a BioEnergy Lab for bench-scale testing, pilot-scale testing and an analytical suite.</p>
                <p>The Centre for Environment and Society Research (CESR) at BCU carries out applied research at the interface between the built and natural environments.  CESR work across disciplinary and theoretical boundaries to tackle a range of complex policy challenges.  There are four centres of excellence within CESR: the Centre for Digital Construction, the Knowledge ExCHANGE Research Centre of Excellence, the Centre of Planning and Environmental Sustainability and the Centre for Plant and Machinery Management.</p>
                <p>"Alexa Torlo, Business Engagement Manager, explains: "We have recognised the increasing importance of the process of ‘cross innovation’, especially as we strive to generate new ideas in a time of global uncertainty.
                <br/><br/>
                "The Open Innovation Lab echoes Climate-KIC’s approach to breaking down silos between sectors and brings companies together to tackle problems and share ideas, coming up with sustainable and cutting edge solutions.
                <br/><br/>
                "The idea behind cross innovation is simple; it focusses on the positive process by which creative industries can drive innovation in the wider economy. This sort of approach is great for generating new ideas and can reap real benefits. We have had a lot of success over the past four years and we are excited to test this approach at Innovation Birmingham with low-carbon and green technology businesses."</p>
